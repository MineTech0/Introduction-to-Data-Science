# Report on GDPR Rights and Practices

## 1. Valid Consent

I chose **Spotify** as the service where I have given *consent* for processing of my personal data (registration data, usage activity, and personalization preferences).

Under **Art 6 (1) a) GDPR**, processing is lawful if the *data subject has given consent*. For this consent to be valid, **Art 7 (1–4) GDPR** and **Recital 32** require that consent is:
- *Freely given*  
- *Specific*  
- *Informed*  
- *Unambiguous*  

Spotify’s privacy notice clearly explains:
- The categories of data collected (registration info, usage, technical data).  
- The purposes (personalized recommendations, advertising, service improvements).  
- The legal bases, including consent for personalized ads and marketing.  

Users are able to manage consent in account settings, which aligns with **Art 7 (3) GDPR** (right to withdraw consent at any time, as easily as it was given).

## 2. Right of Access

The **Right of Access** is covered in **Art 15 (1–3) GDPR**. As a data subject, I have the right to obtain confirmation whether my data is being processed, and if so, access to:
- Purposes of processing  
- Categories of data  
- Recipients / data transfers  
- Storage periods  
- Existence of rights to rectification or erasure  
- Right to lodge a complaint  
- Source of data (if not collected directly)  
- Existence of automated decision-making  

### Access Request Example
I filed an access request with **Google** via the “Download your data” tool (Google Takeout). This mechanism enables users to export data across services (Gmail, YouTube, Drive, etc.), fulfilling **Art 15 (3) GDPR**, which states that the controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing.

**Evaluation:**
- Google provides broad access through self-service tools, which is efficient.  
- However, it requires user initiative and technical effort, which may hinder less tech-savvy individuals.  
- While the GDPR requires responses “without undue delay” and at the latest within one month (**Art 12 (3) GDPR**), Google’s automated system usually provides immediate access, so this aspect is well respected.

## 3. Anonymisation & Pseudonymisation

- **Anonymisation**: Personal data is *irreversibly altered* so that a data subject can no longer be identified by any means reasonably likely to be used. Fully anonymised data is not considered personal data and is therefore outside the scope of GDPR (**Recital 26 GDPR**).  

- **Pseudonymisation**: Personal data is processed in a way that it can no longer be attributed to a specific individual without additional information (kept separately and protected). However, pseudonymised data is still considered personal data under the GDPR (**Art 4 (5) GDPR**), since re-identification is possible.  

**Key Difference:**  
- *Anonymisation* = irreversible → no longer personal data.  
- *Pseudonymisation* = reversible with a key → still personal data under GDPR.
